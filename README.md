# voice-assistant
voice assistant is a software application capable of interpreting human speech and responding with relevant information or performing tasks. These assistants are designed to make our lives easier by allowing us to interact with technology using natural language. They can perform various functions such as:

Listening and Understanding: They use speech recognition technology to convert spoken words into text.

Processing Commands: Using natural language processing (NLP), they understand and interpret the commands.

Executing Tasks: They can perform tasks like web searches, setting reminders, checking the weather, playing music, controlling smart home devices, and more.

Responding: They use text-to-speech (TTS) technology to convert text back into spoken words, providing feedback or information.
